## Introduction ##
There was a **Getting Started with C#** in browser tutorial at official website. Now, Microsoft reroutes to a new module.  

I was happy to find about the design pattern in the old documents. Concepts of design patterns are introduced in clear way. I am going back to archive.org and just copy paste this notes for the future purpose.
